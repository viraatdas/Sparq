# Sparq
Dating apps where AI decides who you date


## Features
- **Visual Taste Learning:** 
  Users swipe on profiles, helping Sparq's algorithm learn their visual preferences.
  
- **Personality Prompts:**
  Users fill out detailed prompts to build an AI that represents their personality, likes, and dislikes.

- **AI Matchmaking:** 
  Sparq's AI uses both the visual preferences and personality data to swipe and match with others in the background.

- **AI Conversations:** 
  Once two AIs match, they chat on behalf of the users, building a rapport based on the users' personalities and preferences.

- **Discriminator AI:**
  After some interaction, Sparq's Discriminator AI decides if the two users are compatible enough to meet in person for a date.

## How It Works
1. **Create Your Profile:**
   - Swipe through profiles, teaching the algorithm your visual preferences.
   - Fill out personality prompts to help the AI understand who you are and what youâ€™re looking for.
   
2. **AI Representation:**
   - Your AI begins swiping for you, based on what it has learned from your inputs.

3. **AI Matchmaking:**
   - If your AI and another AI match, they begin chatting.
   
4. **Discriminator AI:**
   - After a brief chat between the AIs, the Discriminator AI evaluates the conversation and decides if the pair should meet in real life.
   
5. **Go On a Date:**
   - If the Discriminator AI approves the match, users are notified and encouraged to set up an in-person date.
